    Author: Bela Bana | https://github.com/belabana
    Story: I requested to get a comprehensive permission report of the customer's exported SharePoint Online sites,
           and needed to find a way to bypass HTTP 429 error given by Azure API due to the high number of requests.
           Referece: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/general/request-throttling-http-403
    Classification: Public
    Disclaimer: Author does not take responsibility for any unexpected outcome that could arise from using this script.
                Please always test it in a virtual lab or UAT environment before executing it in production environment.
        
.SYNOPSIS
    Import the list of site collections and query SharePoint Online to get and export the permissions for each site.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script will help service desk to collect information about active permissions in association with each site collection.
    It requires and works from an up to date list of sites provided in a CSV file. Reference: C:\temp\SPO_Sites.csv
    It uses the given URL and administrator credentials to connect to and query the targeted SharePoint Online tenancy.
    The permission report will be exported to a CSV file. Path: “C:\temp”
    Transcript and stopwatch are also added to calculate runtime and write output to a .log file. Path: “C:\temp”
    It should be executed with the credentials of a user with full SharePoint Online access and from a computer with Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell module.
    To avoid throttling issue with Azure, you might need to increase the time to sleep value in the for loop. Line 85.

.PARAMETER SPOAdminURL
    The hyperlink pointing to the customer's SharePoint Online Admin Portal.
    Reference: "https://yourcompanydomain-admin.sharepoint.com"

.PARAMETER SPOAdminCredential
    Credentials of a user with full SharePoint Online Administrator access.
